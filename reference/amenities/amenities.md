## 2. Amenities Under Consideration (Hyatt is Thinking of Adding)

| Amenity | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Spa** | Some sources suggest the property already has spa services — needs verification. Competitors like Pelican Hill, Balboa Bay Club, and Pendry all have full-service spas. |
| **Bigger Gym / Fitness Center** | Current gym is small relative to the property size and competitor offerings. Equinox (nearby on Jamboree Rd) charges $215/mo for premium fitness. |

---

## 3. Recommended Amenities (Should Add for Members Club)

### High Priority — Core Members Club Offerings

| Amenity | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Members Club / Clubhouse** | Dedicated private space for members — lounge, concierge, private events. Competitors: Newport Beach Country Club (65,000 sq ft clubhouse), Balboa Bay Club (since 1948), The House Newport Beach. |
| **Full-Service Spa & Wellness Center** | Must-have for luxury positioning. Compete with: Spa at Pelican Hill, Spa Pendry, Balboa Bay Club spa. Include treatment rooms, sauna, steam room. |
| **Expanded Fitness Center** | Significant upgrade needed. Should include: premium cardio/strength, functional fitness area, Peloton/connected equipment, group fitness studio (yoga, pilates), dedicated locker rooms with sauna/steam. Compete with: Equinox ($215/mo), NBAC (rooftop track, dedicated spaces). |
| **All-Day Cafe / Co-Working Lounge** | Cafe currently only operates mornings. A full-day cafe with WiFi, power outlets, laptop-friendly seating, quality coffee/food would attract remote workers and create daily member traffic. No strong competitor for this in the immediate area. |
| **Multiple Restaurants** | Currently only SHOR. A members club should offer variety — casual dining, fine dining, grab-and-go. Newport Beach Country Club and Balboa Bay Club both have multiple dining options. |
| **Rooftop Bar** | Premium social amenity. Lido House has the only notable rooftop bar in Newport Beach — significant gap in the market. Ocean/bay views from the Hyatt property would be a major draw. |

### Medium Priority — Differentiators

| Amenity | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Private Pool / Cabana Area** | Dedicated members-only pool separate from hotel guests. Balboa Bay Club has an exclusive heated waterfront pool. |
| **Kids Club / Family Programming** | Family-friendly programming for members with children. Summer camps, supervised activities. |
| **Business Center / Private Meeting Rooms** | Small bookable rooms for members — calls, meetings, focused work. Complements the co-working cafe. |
| **Yacht / Marina Access** | The House Newport Beach offers 250 ft of private docking. Proximity to Back Bay and harbor is an asset. |
| **Wellness Programming** | Sound baths, meditation, IV therapy, cryotherapy — trending wellness offerings in the area (see: Sacred Healing Sessions, The Hydration Room nearby). |

### Lower Priority — Nice to Have

| Amenity | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Barbershop / Salon** | NBAC has a barbershop on-site. Premium grooming adds to the "club" feel. |
| **Pro Shop Upgrade** | For tennis, pickleball, golf — retail + equipment services. |
| **Outdoor Event Lawn** | Dedicated members-only event space for socials, wine tastings, holiday parties. |
| **Splash Pad / Family Pool** | Differentiate hotel pools from family-friendly member area. |

## 5. Competitive Gaps & Opportunities

### The Core Pitch

**No competitor combines all these amenities under one membership** — gym + pool + courts + workspace + dining + bar. The Hyatt is surrounded by $150K+ country clubs (Big Canyon, NB Country Club) but there's nothing in the **$300–500/mo accessible-premium tier for younger professionals (25–40)**. That's the gap.

### Specific Gaps

1. **Within 1 mile of the Hyatt, there are almost no cafes, coworking spaces, or wellness/spa options** — those are all clustered around Lido, Balboa Peninsula, and Fashion Island. The immediate area is a desert for the remote-worker demo.

2. **The pool opportunity is unmatched** — 3 pools on 26 acres vs. everyone else's single hotel pool. Not yet curated as a social scene, but this is the single biggest competitive advantage.

3. **No rooftop bar exists in the immediate Hyatt area** — Lido House is the closest competitor, and it's further toward the peninsula. The Hyatt's elevation and location make this a strong play.

4. **Pickleball/padel is a white space** — All supply is public courts with zero amenities. No leagues, no social programming, no lounge attached. Huge opportunity for the 25–40 demo.

5. **No dedicated co-working / all-day cafe concept nearby** — The best options are coffee shops with limited seating and no outlets (Herst has no WiFi). A premium cafe-meets-club-lounge is completely missing.

6. **Every competitor hotel has a spa — the Hyatt doesn't** — SPA VEA (Marriott), Spa Pendry, Pelican Hill all have full-service spas. No spa = missing a core members club amenity.

7. **The Hyatt's 26-acre footprint is an advantage** — Most competitors are on much smaller properties. Room to expand (bigger gym, spa, additional restaurants) without acquiring land.

8. **Tennis infrastructure is already best-in-class** — 16 lighted courts at Palisades Tennis Club is more than any competitor. Leaning into racquet sports (tennis + pickleball) is a strength.

9. **Golf is a differentiator but limited** — 9-hole executive course won't compete with NB Country Club (18 holes) or Pelican Hill (36 holes), but it's a convenient perk. Could add a golf simulator / TopGolf-style social experience.

10. **thehouse Newport Beach is waitlisted at 450 members** — Proves demand for a members-only social/bar concept in Newport Beach. The Hyatt could absorb this demand at scale.
